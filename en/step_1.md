The `console.log()` method is used to output messages that tell you what the JavaScript code is doing.

You can use `console.log()` for testing and debugging your code.

Most browsers will let you right click on a page and 'Inspect' an element. 

This opens developer tools, including the Console.

Some helpful keyboard shortcuts to open developer tools:

+ Chrome: Ctrl + Shift + J (on Windows) or Cmd + Option + J (on a Mac)
+ Firefox: Ctrl + Shift + J (on Windows) or Cmd + Option + K (on a Mac)
+ Microsoft Edge: Control + Shift + I
+ Safari: First, enable the 'Develop menu'. To do this, click 'Safari' in the Mac menu bar and select 'Settings.' Click on 'Advanced', tick the checkbox next to 'Show features for web developers' and then close the window. You can now open the console using Cmd + Option + C.
